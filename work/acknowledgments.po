"First, I want to thank the other members of the CLOS working group, who gave "
"time, thought, and energy in creating this language standard and integrating "
"the power of object-oriented programming into Common Lisp. These people are: "
"Daniel G. Bobrow, Linda G. DeMichiel, Patrick Dussud, Richard P. Gabriel, "
"James Kempf, Gregor Kiczales, and David \n"
"A. Moon. Many other people contributed ideas and assistance to the working "
"group, including Kenneth Kahn, Larry Masinter, Mark Stefik, Daniel L. "
"Weinreb, and Jon L. White. I would also like to thank Robert Mathis and Guy "
"L. Steele Jr., the conveners of the X3J13 committee, \n"
"for creating an environment in which technical work is supported and "
"encouraged."

"This book depends on information covered in the \"Common Lisp Object System "
"Specification,\" which is the complete definition of the behavior of CLOS, "
"and should be considered the primary source of information on CLOS. The "
"authors of the \"Common Lisp Object System Specification\" (Daniel G. "
"Bobrow, Linda G. DeMichiel, Richard P. Gabriel, Sonya E. Keene, Gregor "
"Kiczales, and David A. Moon) have kindly given me their permission to adapt "
"that information in this book. I am responsible for the form, style, and "
"content of this book, and for any errors in it. "

"My first step in writing this book was to find or develop good example "
"programs. Most object-oriented programs are sizable—a window system is one "
"example. For this book, however, I wanted straightforward examples that "
"would illustrate CLOS without distracting readers by the implementation "
"details of a window system or some other complicated application. Dan Gerson "
"showed me a locking program that was part of a larger application; it was "
"simple, yet took good advantage of multiple inheritance. We adapted it for "
"this book. Dan became interested in the book and developed the remote-"
"evaluation and stream examples. I am very grateful to Dan for these examples "
"and for his insights into object-oriented programming."

"Jonathan Ostrowsky and Tom Parmenter supported this book when it was nothing "
"more than an idea. When I broached the idea to Tom, I convinced him that I "
"could write this book, and several weeks later he convinced me that I could "
"write it. Jonathan and Tom paved the way \n"
"for me to write this book by giving me the time and resources to do it."

"Kate Johnson shaped my book by editing early drafts, showing me the places "
"where it didn't make sense, and even finding bugs in the example programs. "
"Bob Mathews was my first technical reviewer, and he stayed with me until the "
"book was finished. His kind and careful reviews made this a better book. "
"These people generously gave their support not only to the book itself, but "
"also to its author."

"I received valuable technical reviews from Daniel Bobrow, Patrick Dussud, "
"Richard Gabriel, James Kempf, Gregor Kizcales, and Guy L. Steele Jr. Several "
"people at Symbolics gave me advice on object-oriented programming, answered "
"Lisp questions, and reviewed my book for tech- nical correctness. These "
"people include John Dunning, Neal Feinberg, Neil Mayle, Kent Pitman, David "
"Plummer, Steve Robbins, Steve Rowley, Janet Walker, and Daniel Weinreb. Tom "
"Diaz, Brad Goldstein, Ilene Lang, Christine Skatell, and David Stryker "
"encouraged me in this \n"
"project and in other endeavors."

"The book design was done by Symbolics Press using the Concordia document-"
"preparation system. Sheryl Avruch, V. Ellen Golden, and Thom Whitaker "
"designed the book. Rick Bryan and Dennis Doughty spent many late nights "
"implementing special design features for the book, and Rick customized the "
"fonts."

"Sheryl Avruch of Symbolics Press gave me the benefit of her experience in "
"publishing; she advised me on the process and coordinated the copublishing "
"arrangement with Addison-Wesley. At Addison-Wesley, I enjoyed working with "
"my editor, Peter Gordon, who recently celebrated \n"
"ten years with Addison-Wesley, and with his able assistant, Helen Goldstein, "
"and with Bette Aaronson, who transformed the camera-ready copy into a real "
"book. "

"David Moon believed in this book from the beginning. He answered innumerable "
"questions, reviewed drafts several times over, and helped me understand the "
"value of these programming techniques. I particularly appreciate his style "
"of giving help—he pointed me in the right direction and encouraged me to get "
"there myself. David evokes the best in people, and working with him is a "
"great pleasure."

"As I wrote this book, I found many doors open to me. Friends, colleagues, "
"and strangers (many of whom turned into friends) offered me not only the "
"concrete kind of help that goes directly into the book, but also advice, "
"encouragement, and spirited conversations about book-writing and object-"
"oriented programming. I had imagined that I could express in these "
"acknowledgments my delight in receiving this bounty of support, but that was "
"a naive hope; I find it impossible to express. All the people already "
"mentioned—along with Suzanne, Wayne, Nancy, and Evelyn Keene, Althea and "
"Richard Lewis, and Valerie and Mun Moy—have contributed to my joy in writing "
"this book."
